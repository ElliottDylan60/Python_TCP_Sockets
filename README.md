# Python_TCP_Sockets
Open TCP connection between Client and Server

**SETUP**

***Server.py***

Set SERVER_HOST and SERVER_PORT to the desired IP address and Port you wish to open a tcp connection on


***Client.py***

Set Proxy_HOST and PROXY_PORT to either the IP address and Port of your proxy, or the IP address and Port opened in the Server.py
If you do not have a proxy, the IP and port will be the same in Client.py and Server.py
 

**How To Run**

After setting up the program, launch Server.py First. Give this a few seconds to fully boot before launching Client.py next. If dont correctly, Client.py will display server information, and will also recieve "Hello and Welcome" From the server.


**How To Use**

After connection between client and server has been made, server side messages can be sent. To test this, try typing commands such as 'dir' or 'ipconfig' Client.py must be ran in administrative mode to send some commands.
